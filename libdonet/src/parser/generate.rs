//! The DC parser outputs an [`Abstract Syntax Tree`], which is just a big
//! nested structure that defines the declarations in the DC file. At runtime,
//! the Donet daemon (and its services) need a class hierarchy structure in
//! memory to access while processing network messages.
//!
//! This source file defines the process of taking in the DC file abstract
//! syntax tree as input and generating an output of a class hierarchy structure,
//! where each class has pointers to its children, and vice versa, with methods
//! that make it easy for the Donet daemon to look up information on the DC contract
//! at runtime in order to understand the network messages it receives.

# libdonet

The libdonet Rust library provides the necessary utilities and definitions for using the Donet networking protocol. These utilities include a lexer, parser, and high-level representation of the DC file, as well as creating datagrams, iterating through datagrams, and the definition of every message type in the Donet protocol.

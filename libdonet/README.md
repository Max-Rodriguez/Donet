# libdonet

The libdonet Rust library provides the necessary utilities and definitions for using the Donet networking protocol. These utilities include a lexer, parser, and high-level representation of the parsed DC file, as well as creating datagrams, iterating through datagrams, and the definition of every message type in the Donet protocol.

The Rust crate documentation is available at
[docs.donet-server.org](https://docs.donet-server.org/libdonet).

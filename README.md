The DoNet software project provides a server-side system that implements the Distributed Class protocol, as defined in the high-level networking API of the [Panda3D](https://panda3d.org) engine,
which was originally designed by Disney Interactive (*formerly known as Disney VR Studios*) to connect with their in-house server technology, the OTP (*Online Theme Park*) server, which was used to power their massive multiplayer online games, such as Toontown Online and Pirates of the Caribbean Online, from 2001 to 2013.

This open source software project will always aim to stay compatible with [Panda3Dâ€™s](https://panda3d.org) high-level network API.

Donet is a free and open source network engine designed after the Distributed
Networking protocol,  as defined in the high-level networking API of the
[Panda3D](https://panda3d.org) game engine, which was originally developed by
Disney Interactive (*formerly known as Disney VR Studios*) to connect with
their in-house server technology, the OTP (*Online Theme Park*) server, which
was used to power their massive multiplayer online games, such as Toontown
Online and Pirates of the Caribbean Online, from 2001 to 2013.

## Getting Started

The Donet repository is a monorepo that houses two different Rust projects:
- **donet** - The Donet daemon source, which includes all the Donet services.
See [donet-server.org](https://www.donet-server.org).
- **libdonet** - The core utilities for Donet services, including datagram
utilities and the DC language parser. See
[lib.donet-server.org](https://lib.donet-server.org).

Please read the [introduction to Donet](./docs/01-Introduction.md) for an
overview of the project and how the engine works.

Before starting your own contribution to Donet, please read over the
[Contributing Guidelines](./CONTRIBUTING.md).

We use Git for version control and Meson as the build system.

The quickest way to build for release is to do the following:

To build Donet, run the following under the project directory:
```sh
meson setup build -Dprofile=debug
meson compile -C build
```

If you are working on a contribution to either the Donet daemon or libdonet,
please run code linting and unit testing before pushing:
```sh
meson compile linting -C build
meson compile tests -C build
```

These checks should go over all source files in the `donet/` and `libdonet/`
source directories.

If you would like to build only certain Donet services into the output binary,
you can use the available Meson options to trigger feature flags in the Crate:
```sh
meson setup build -Dbuild_state_server=true
```

If any `build_*` Meson options are passed, `--no-default-features` is passed
to cargo build, which disables building all services. Only the service(s) that
you explicitly request to be built will be activated via feature flags.

### Debugging Unit Tests

To debug unit tests with a debugger such as [GDB](https://sourceware.org/gdb/),
you need to have the unit tests binary. You can build this with the following
Meson build command:
```sh
meson compile build-tests -C build
```

This Meson run target will build unit tests for each crate in the workspace.
The unit test binaries should be written to the following path:
```
build/target/debug/deps/donetd-<hash>
build/target/debug/deps/libdonet-<hash>
```

### Reviewing Coverage Reports Locally

The latest commit's unit test code coverage report can be viewed online at
[https://codecov.io](https://codecov.io/gl/donet-server/donet). The dashboard
displays the code coverage percentage for the entire project and allows you
to view covered and missing lines per source file if you are logged in.

During development, you may need to inspect the code coverage report directly
from your latest local changes before you can see it on the online dashboard
after pushing a new commit.

Donet uses [Tarpaulin](https://github.com/xd009642/tarpaulin) to generate
code coverage reports. To build the coverage report locally, run the following
run target using Meson:
```sh
meson compile code-coverage -C build
```

The output of this run target should be 2 coverage report files:
```
build/target/tarpaulin/cobertura.xml
build/target/tarpaulin/coverage.json
```

These are large XML/JSON files, so you will need a tool to view the report.
You can use [pycobertura](https://github.com/aconrad/pycobertura) to view the
code coverage report from your terminal. To do this, run:
```sh
python -m pip install pycobertura
python -m pycobertura show build/target/tarpaulin/cobertura.xml
```

Donet is a free and open source network engine designed after the Distributed Networking protocol, 
as defined in the high-level networking API of the [Panda3D](https://panda3d.org) game engine,
which was originally developed by Disney Interactive (*formerly known as Disney VR Studios*) to connect 
with their in-house server technology, the OTP (*Online Theme Park*) server, which was used to power 
their massive multiplayer online games, such as Toontown Online and Pirates of the Caribbean Online, 
from 2001 to 2013.

Donet is currently in its early stages, but it aims to be a drop-in replacement for [Astron](https://github.com/astron/astron).

How is the Donet project **unique** from Astron?

- Donet source is licensed under the GNU Affero General Public License, which is a **copyleft free software license** that
classifies public network use as distribution under its terms. Astron uses the Modified BSD License, which is a permissive
software license.
- The libdonet core library is made to be **fully backwards compatible** with Panda's legacy DC file parser, which includes
support for DC switch statements for more complex/dynamic fields. This is beneficial for maintaining projects with legacy code.
- Donet development comes with **unit testing** and code coverage reports. Functional testing is also in the works. Along with
the benefits of safety with Rust, we do our best to guarantee the integrity of the Donet server.
- Donet is a brand new open source project! We're in **active development** and plan to make more improvements in the future.
We welcome with open arms new contributors to share in the development of Donet.

## Getting Started
The Donet repository houses two different Rust projects:
- **donet** - The Donet daemon source, which includes all the Donet services. See [donet-server.org](https://www.donet-server.org).
- **libdonet** - The core utilities for Donet services, including Datagrams and the DC file parser. See [libdonet.rs](https://libdonet.rs).

Please read the [introduction to Donet](./docs/01-Introduction.md) for an overview of the project 
and how the engine works.

If you have any questions, feel free to join [our community Discord server](https://discord.gg/T6jGjEutfy).

## Documentation
Currently there is not much documentation on Donet, as libdonet is still under development.

For the libdonet rust library documentation, visit [libdonet.rs](https://libdonet.rs).

## Software License
The Donet engine is released under the GNU Affero General Public License, version 3.0 (AGPL-3.0), which 
is a copyleft open source software license. The terms of this license are available in the 
"[LICENSE](./LICENSE)" file.

This server software project implements the Distributed Class system and protocol in Panda3D's distributed module for networking,
which was originally designed to interact with a server technology, the OTP server, designed by Disney and used in-house from 2001 to 2013.

This open source software project will always aim to stay compatible with the networking module of the Panda3D engine.

# donet

Donet is a free and open source network engine designed after the Distributed Networking protocol, 
as defined in the high-level networking API of the [Panda3D](https://panda3d.org) game engine,
which was originally developed by Disney Interactive (*formerly known as Disney VR Studios*) to connect 
with their in-house server technology, the OTP (*Online Theme Park*) server, which was used to power 
their massive multiplayer online games, such as Toontown Online and Pirates of the Caribbean Online, 
from 2001 to 2013.

## Getting Started
The Donet repository houses three different Rust projects:
- **donet** - The Donet daemon source, which includes all the Donet services. See [donet-server.org](https://www.donet-server.org).
- **libdonet** - The core utilities for Donet services, including datagram utilities and the DC language parser. See [libdonet.rs](https://libdonet.rs).
- **bevy_donet** - A Bevy plugin for the [Bevy game engine](https://bevyengine.org) that provides the client-side implementation for Donet.
This integrates Donet to the engine by translating network field updates to Bevy ECS operations.

Please read the [introduction to Donet](./docs/01-Introduction.md) for an overview of the project 
and how the engine works.

Before starting your own contribution to Donet, please read over the [Contributing Guidelines](./CONTRIBUTING.md). If you are a first
time contributor to the project, please add your name and Git email address to the [CONTRIBUTORS.md](./CONTRIBUTORS.md) markdown file.
You may also use your GitHub username as your name. If your contribution includes modifications to source code, please add your
name and Git email in the [Cargo.toml](./Cargo.toml) file as an author of this project.

To build Donet, run the following under the project directory:
```sh
cargo build --release
```

> **NOTE**
>
> The `bevy_donet` crate is not a *default* member of the main cargo project workspace.
> Only the `donet` and `libdonet` crates are default members of the workspace as they
> are both required to build the server daemon binary.
>
> To build the `bevy_donet` crate, run:
> ```sh
> cargo build --package bevy_donet
> ```


If you are working on a contribution to either the Donet daemon or libdonet, please run code linting and unit testing before pushing:
```sh
cargo clippy
cargo fmt --all -- --check
cargo test
```
These checks should go over all source files in the `bevy_donet/`, `donet/`, and `libdonet/` source directories.

The DoNet software project is a network engine that implements the Distributed Networking protocol, 
as defined in the high-level networking API of the [Panda3D](https://panda3d.org) game engine,
which was originally developed by Disney Interactive (*formerly known as Disney VR Studios*) to connect 
with their in-house server technology, the OTP (*Online Theme Park*) server, which was used to power 
their massive multiplayer online games, such as Toontown Online and Pirates of the Caribbean Online, 
from 2001 to 2013.

DoNet is currently in its early stages, but it aims to be a drop-in replacement for [Astron](https://github.com/astron/astron).

## Software License
The DoNet engine is released under the GNU Affero General Public License, version 3.0 (AGPL-3.0), which 
is a copyleft open source software license. The terms of this license are available in the

## Getting Started

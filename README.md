Donet is a free and open source network engine designed after the Distributed
Networking protocol,  as defined in the high-level networking API of the
[Panda3D](https://panda3d.org) game engine, which was originally developed by
Disney Interactive (*formerly known as Disney VR Studios*) to connect with
their in-house server technology, the OTP (*Online Theme Park*) server, which
was used to power their massive multiplayer online games, such as Toontown
Online and Pirates of the Caribbean Online, from 2001 to 2013.

## Getting Started

The Donet repository is a monorepo that houses two different Rust projects:
- **donet** - The Donet daemon source, which includes all the Donet services.
See [donet-server.org](https://www.donet-server.org).
- **libdonet** - The core utilities for Donet services, including datagram
utilities and the DC language parser. See
[docs.donet-server.org](https://docs.donet-server.org/libdonet).

Please read the
[introduction to Donet](https://docs.donet-server.org/introduction)
for an overview of the project and how the engine works.

Before starting your own contribution to Donet, please read over the
[Contributing Guidelines](https://docs.donet-server.org/internal/guidelines).

We use Git for version control and Meson as the build system.

The quickest way to build for release is to do the following:

To build Donet, run the following under the project directory:
```sh
meson setup build -Dprofile=debug
meson compile -C build
```

If you are working on a contribution to either the Donet daemon or libdonet,
please run code linting and unit testing before pushing:
```sh
meson compile linting -C build
meson compile tests -C build
```

These checks should go over all source files in the `donet/` and `libdonet/`
source directories.

If you would like to build only certain Donet services into the output binary,
you can use the available Meson options to trigger feature flags in the Crate:
```sh
meson setup build -Dbuild_state_server=true
```

If any `build_*` Meson options are passed, `--no-default-features` is passed
to cargo build, which disables building all services. Only the service(s) that
you explicitly request to be built will be activated via feature flags.
